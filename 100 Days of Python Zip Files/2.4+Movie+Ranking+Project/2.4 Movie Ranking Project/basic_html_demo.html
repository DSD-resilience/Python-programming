<h1>The Best Movies According to John</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Commitments</h3>
<p>This is a musical featuring an Irish soul band. Sexy, funny, speaks to me.</p>
<h3>Godfather I and II</h3>
<p>Difficult for me to separate, provides lessons in power and loss.</p>
<h3>2001: A Space Odyssey</h3>
<p>Super beautiful film, rejuvenated the genre. Really artistic. Attempts to convey feeling in the same way as music.</p>
